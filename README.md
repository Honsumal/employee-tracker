# Employee Tracker

## Description

This application is an employee tracker that runs through the CLI and uses user input to create a database that stores all the important information about each employee, role, and department in a company. The application also includes features to add, update, or delete employees, roles, or departments, and also allows the user to view employees by their managers (if they have one), or by the department they are currently in. This application contains all the features needed for a small company to keep track of all its employees, and also allows said company to modify the database with ease.
